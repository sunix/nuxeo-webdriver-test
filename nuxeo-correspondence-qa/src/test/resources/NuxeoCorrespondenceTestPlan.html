<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>Purpose of this document</h2>
<p>This document contains a set of tests allowing to ensure that the
Nuxeo Correspondence project works well.</p>


<p>Managing incoming correspondence from different mediums (fax,
letters, email), while meeting mandated turnaround times and audit
trails, is a time- and resource-intensive undertaking when
correspondence intake and responses are not streamlined and automated.
When the software used to automate correspondence management is not
sufficiently flexible to meet specific vertical or jurisdictional
requirements, or can't scale across distributed environments,
deployment, integration or customization burdens can quickly become
prohibitive.</p>

<p>The Correspondence Management template for <a
  href="http://www.nuxeo.com/en/products/case-management">Nuxeo Case
Management Framework</a> provides a configurable application built on a
proven framework built to deliver a streamlined approach for the
rigorous needs of public sector and regulated industries. It offers the
inbox management, delegation, routing, and tracking features necessary
for managing all types of incoming correspondence and outbound responses
and is based on a content management platform that provides the
security, auditing, lifecycle and classification demanded by government
and regulated markets.</p>


<p>The tests will be run on a Nuxeo Correspondence with an empty
database (h2)</p>
