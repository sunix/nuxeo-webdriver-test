<h1>Working with filing trees</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Classification trees are folders associated to the mailboxes in
which users can classify case items. It enables them to find and
organize documents another way. Classification trees work the same way
folders do in Nuxeo DM. Access is determined by access rights, documents
can be deleted and moved into the folder's trash.</p>
<p>Access rights are inherited from the mailbox. This means that all the mailbox delegates automatically have access to the mailbox's classification folders.</p>
<p>You can classify cases as soon as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>you can access them (ie when you are a delegate of a recipient mailbox)</li>
  <li>and you have "Classify" right in the target classification folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>The complete
functional documentation can be found here: <a

<ul>
  <li>Having that
  <ul>
    <li>The users John Doe and Bree are created</li>
    <li>The server is started, connecting to
    http://localhost:8080/nuxeo displays the default login page.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Access rights are inherited from the mailbox.
  This means that all the mailbox delegates automatically have access to
  the mailbox's classification folders.
  <ul>
    <li>When
    <ul>
      <li>With its username <span concordion:set="#username">jdoe</span>
      and its password <span concordion:set="#password">jdoe1</span> and
      the language <span concordion:set="#language">English</span>, the
      user John Doe <span
        concordion:assertEquals="login(#username,#password,#language)">login</span></li>
      <li>In the Administration tab of the mailbox, click on the
      Delegation sub-tab</li>
      <li>Add bree as a delegate by typing the first characters of
      Bree and saving</li>
      <li>With the username <span concordion:set="#username">bree</span>
      and its password <span concordion:set="#password">bree1</span> and
      the language <span concordion:set="#language">English</span>, the
      user Bree <span
        concordion:assertEquals="login(#username,#password,#language)">login</span></li>
    </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <ul>
    <li>Then
    <ul>
      <li>Bree should see John Doe mailbox in her main page</li>
      <li>Trying to delete her self from the mailbox delegates
      should fail</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
